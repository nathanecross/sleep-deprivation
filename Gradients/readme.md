# Background
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess activations and connectivity during cognitive tasks in 20 healthy young adults, during three states: (i) following a normal night of sleep, (ii) following 24hr of total sleep deprivation, and (iii) after a morning recovery nap. Situating cortical activity during cognitive tasks along hierarchical organising gradients based upon similarity of functional connectivity patterns, we found that regional task-activations were captured by an axis differentiating areas involved in executive control from default mode regions and paralimbic cortex. After global signal regression, the range of functional differentiation along this axis at baseline was significantly related to decline in working memory performance (2-back task) following sleep deprivation, as well as the extent of recovery in performance following a nap.
